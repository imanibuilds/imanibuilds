### Hi, I'm Imani. Thanks for stopping by!

I'm an early-stage Engineer with a knack for front-end development. 

Currently, I'm learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and creating projects that reflect my understanding of the languahges.

I am open to collaborate with startups and individuals.

Also, feel free to check out my [blog](https://imanidevelops.hashnode.dev/) where I'll be sharing what I've learned and documenting my journey.
