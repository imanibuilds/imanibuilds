### Hi, I'm Imani. Thanks for stopping by!

I'm an early-stage Software Engineer.

Currently, I'm JavaScript and creating projects based off of them.

I am open to collaborate with businesses of all sizes and individuals.

Also, feel free to check out my [blog](https://imanidevelops.hashnode.dev/) where I'll be sharing what I've learned and documenting my journey.
